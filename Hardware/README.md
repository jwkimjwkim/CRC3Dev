WingSpar.dxf: file used to laser cut balsa wood spar

WingXSolid.dxf: file used to laser cut airfoil cross section

SupportBoard.dxf: file used to laser cut balsa wood support struts that run perpendicular to the wings. NOTE: I recommend measuring the gap on the drone itself and sizing this part according to how you want everything spaced.
